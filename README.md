# MechaCar Statistical Analysis

## Linear Regression to Predict Fuel Economy (MPG)

A linear model was constructed to predict fuel economy (MPG) of MechaCar prototypes based on other variables avariable (Vehicle Length, Weight, Spoiler Angle, Ground Clearance, and AWD). The model was found to be highly significant (p = 5.35E-11) and explained roughly 70% of the variation in the dependent variable (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.7149). Thus, H<sub>0</sub> can be rejected in favor of H<sub>A</sub>, i.e. the slope is statistically different from zero. The model indicates that vehicle weight and ground clearance are highly significant predictors (p << 0..05 for both).
